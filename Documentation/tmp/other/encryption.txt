This project aims to develop a File Encryptor in C++ that provides a secure way to encrypt and decrypt files using a key. 

The application will utilize standard encryption algorithms, allowing users to safeguard sensitive data. 

The encryptor will support a command-line interface (CLI) to ensure simple, quick operations, and its primary function will be to encrypt a file using a password-based key, ensuring that files remain inaccessible without the correct decryption key.









Insecure Data Protection:
With the increasing amount of sensitive data being stored and shared electronically, many individuals and organizations face the risk of unauthorized access to important files, leading to potential data breaches, identity theft, or privacy violations. The need for secure encryption methods to protect files during storage and transmission has become critical.

Inefficient Manual Encryption Methods:
Many users still rely on basic or manual methods for encrypting files, which often lack proper security features, are difficult to use, and are prone to errors. These manual methods can lead to inadequate protection of sensitive information and increased vulnerability to cyber threats.



















**Motivation**  

**Enhancing Data Security:**  
Traditional methods of storing and sharing files often lack proper security measures, making sensitive data vulnerable to unauthorized access. Our project aims to provide a robust encryption tool that ensures the protection of confidential information.  

**Simplifying Encryption and Decryption:**  
Many existing encryption tools are either too complex for everyday users or lack essential security features. Our File Encryptor in C++ streamlines the process, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt files easily while maintaining high levels of security.  



**Objectives**  
Develop a secure file encryption and decryption system using C++.
Implement a password-based encryption method to ensure data protection.
Provide a command-line interface (CLI) for easy and quick encryption operations.
Ensure that encrypted files remain inaccessible without the correct decryption key.
Enhance cybersecurity by preventing unauthorized access to sensitive files.




**Business Model**  
*For Final Year Project Only (If Required)*
- **Freemium Model:** Offer a basic encryption tool for free, with a premium version providing advanced security features.
- **One-Time License Fee:** Sell the software as a one-time purchase for individuals and businesses requiring offline encryption tools.
- **Subscription-Based Model:** Provide a cloud-based encryption service where users can securely store and access their encrypted files.
