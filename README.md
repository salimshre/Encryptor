🔒 Encryptor++

🚀 Encryptor++ is a high-performance encryption tool built in C++ that leverages the best cryptographic algorithms to secure your data. Designed for speed, security, and simplicity, this project ensures that your sensitive information remains protected.

📌 Features

✅ Advanced encryption algorithms (AES, RSA, etc.)✅ Fast and efficient encryption & decryption✅ User-friendly command-line interface✅ Secure key management system✅ Open-source and customizable

⚙️ Algorithms Used

We employ state-of-the-art encryption techniques:

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) - Symmetric encryption for secure data storage.

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) - Asymmetric encryption for secure key exchange.

Caesar Cipher - A simple encryption technique for demonstration.

Custom Hashing - Hash functions to validate data integrity.

🛠️ Installation & Usage

🔽 Clone the Repository

 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Encryptor-CPP.git
 cd Encryptor-CPP

🏗️ Compile the Program

g++ encryptor.cpp -o encryptor

▶️ Run the Program

./encryptor

📝 How It Works

Choose the encryption method.

Input the text or file to be encrypted.

Provide a secure key (if applicable).

Get the encrypted output.

Decrypt using the correct key.

📌 Example Usage

Encrypt a message:

Enter text to encrypt: Hello World
Choose algorithm (AES, RSA, Caesar): AES
Enter key: mysecurekey
Encrypted Output: Xk9sI3zB2...

Decrypt a message:

Enter encrypted text: Xk9sI3zB2...
Choose algorithm: AES
Enter key: mysecurekey
Decrypted Output: Hello World
