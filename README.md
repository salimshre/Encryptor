## ⚙️ Algorithms Used

We employ state-of-the-art encryption techniques:

- 🔐 **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** - Symmetric encryption for secure data storage.
- 🔑 **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)** - Asymmetric encryption for secure key exchange.
- 🏛️ **Caesar Cipher** - A simple encryption technique for demonstration.
- 🛡 **Custom Hashing** - Hash functions to validate data integrity.

## 📝 How It Works

1️⃣ Choose the encryption method.\
2️⃣ Input the text or file to be encrypted.\
3️⃣ Provide a secure key (if applicable).\
4️⃣ Get the encrypted output.\
5️⃣ Decrypt using the correct key.

## 📌 Example Usage

🔒 **Encrypt a message:**

```sh
Enter text to encrypt: Hello World
Choose algorithm (AES, RSA, Caesar): AES
Enter key: mysecurekey
Encrypted Output: Xk9sI3zB2...
```

🔓 **Decrypt a message:**

```sh
Enter encrypted text: Xk9sI3zB2...
Choose algorithm: AES
Enter key: mysecurekey
Decrypted Output: Hello World
```
